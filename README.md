PERSONAL PORTFOLIO PROJECT THEORY:

While this project is small to medium in size, I designed the folder structure to show how I would approach scalability for potentially larger codebases. The abstractions demonstrate how I’d handle a growing feature set and maintain clear separation of concerns.

In professional projects, I’ve found that modular structures help with maintainability, especially when the team size or feature scope increases. I applied this structure here to mimic that approach.

I understand this level of abstraction isn't strictly necessary for a portfolio project of this size. However, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to showcase my understanding of scalable structures and leave room for potential growth as my skills and abilities are forever changing and adapting.
